## Notes

I was able to fix issues from last week's lab (next button functionality and flipping the card back and forth when it is clicked). I also implemented previous button features and implemented the input field. I am experiencing challenges with the input field processing user input and providing visual feedback. I will work to fix this issues before the 48 hour extension after this initial submission. (AS OF 3/13/2023 9:55PM ET)
